// 1. Create a class Car with instance variables model and year. Create two car objects and display their details.
// 2. Add a static variable numberOfCars in the Car class from Q1 to count how many objects have been created.
// 3. Create a method inside a class that declares a local variable. Try printing it outside the method. What happens?
